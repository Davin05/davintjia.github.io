Hi, this is Davin. I am a third year undergrad student at University of Washington studying computer science. I am in 
[WEIRD](https://weirdlab.cs.washington.edu/) lab advised by [Abhishek Gupta](https://abhishekunique.github.io/). I am interested in 
Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and other Deep Learning related applications. I am particularly
passionate about teaching robots to perceive this world, whether it is through interactions, language feedbacks, or visual cues. 

In my free time, I love watching movies and TV shows, reading, and hanging out with my friends. I also love watching basketball and follow NBA closely.

Feel free to contact me through my email.
