Welcome to the home page of Davin Tjia's personal website. I am a second-year undergraduate student in University of Washington's honors program studying engineering. 
I am most passionate about the interdisciplinary field of computational neuroscience, especially the cross-over between theoretical neuroscience and computer science. 
In addition, I am also interested in mathematics, bioengineering, and biological science in general. Outside of school, I enjoy reading, watching movies and TV shows, 
cooking and baking, and anything related to basketball. Currently, I am most excited about moving to Seattle in mid-September and stepping on the campus of Unviersity of 
Washington for the first time of my life despite being their student for a full year.
